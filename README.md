# Customers and Products Analysis Using SQL


## Description

This project focuses on conducting a comprehensive analysis of customer and product data using SQL to derive valuable insights that can guide strategic decision-making. The analysis addresses three key questions to help us better understand our business and make data-driven decisions.

## Key Questions and Answers

**Question 1: Which products should we order more of or less of?**

Our analysis has revealed that Classic Cars should be the top priority for restocking. These products not only sell frequently but also offer high-profit margins, making them the highest-performing products in our inventory.

**Question 2: How should we match marketing and communication strategies to customer behaviors?**

We have segmented our customers into two crucial categories: VIP customers and least-engaged customers. VIP customers, like Diego Freyre and Susan Nelson, contribute significantly to our profits. Understanding their preferences and behaviors can help tailor marketing and communication strategies to enhance their loyalty. We've also identified least-engaged customers, such as Mary Young and Leslie Taylor, which allows us to devise strategies to re-engage and retain them, ultimately driving loyalty and attracting new customers.

**Question 3: How much can we spend on acquiring new customers?**

The Customer Lifetime Value (LTV) metric provides a glimpse into the potential profitability of an average customer over their lifetime with our store. With an LTV of approximately $39,039, we now have the insights needed to allocate resources effectively for customer acquisition and plan for sustainable growth.
