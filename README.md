# Customers and Products Analysis Using SQL

## Introduction

Welcome to the "Customers and Products Analysis Using SQL" project. In this project, we aim to answer three important questions to gain valuable insights for our business strategy. Below are the answers to these questions.

## Questions and Answers

**Question 1: Which products should we order more of or less of?**

Based on our analysis, the top priority for restocking should be "Classic Cars." These products not only sell frequently but are also high-performance items.

| productName                                | productLine    |
| ----------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| 1952 Alpine Renault 1300                  | Classic Cars   |
| 2003 Harley-Davidson Eagle Drag Bike      | Motorcycles    |
| 1968 Ford Mustang                         | Classic Cars   |
| 2001 Ferrari Enzo                         | Classic Cars   |
| 2002 Suzuki XREO                          | Motorcycles    |
| 1969 Ford Falcon                          | Classic Cars   |
| 1980s Black Hawk Helicopter               | Planes         |
| 1917 Grand Touring Sedan                  | Vintage Cars   |
| 1998 Chrysler Plymouth Prowler            | Classic Cars   |

**Question 2: How should we match marketing and communication strategies to customer behaviors?**

We have identified two crucial customer segments for tailored marketing:

**VIP Customers:**
- Diego Freyre from Madrid, Spain
- Susan Nelson from San Rafael, USA
- Jeff Young from NYC, USA
- Peter Ferguson from Melbourne, Australia
- Janine Labrune from Nantes, France

**Least Engaged Customers:**
- Mary Young from Glendale, USA
- Leslie Taylor from Brickhaven, USA
- Franco Ricotti from Milan, Italy
- Carine Schmitt from Nantes, France
- Thomas Smith from London, UK

Identifying these customer segments enables us to drive loyalty among VIP customers and develop strategies to engage with the least engaged customers effectively.

**Question 3: How much can we spend on acquiring new customers?**

The Customer Lifetime Value (LTV) is approximately $39,039.59. LTV represents the profit an average customer generates during their lifetime with our store. This prediction can guide our budget allocation for acquiring new customers, helping us make informed decisions for future growth.

## Conclusion

In this project, we harnessed the power of SQL to extract essential insights that can shape our business strategy. By identifying priority products for restocking, understanding customer behaviors, and determining a budget for customer acquisition, we are now well-equipped to make data-driven decisions to enhance our business's success.

## Project Summary

This project exemplifies how data analysis can empower businesses to make strategic decisions. By leveraging the wealth of data available, we can not only understand our products and customers better but also drive growth and profitability. With these insights, we can navigate the future confidently, making our business more successful and competitive.
