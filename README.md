1. Which Product should we Order More or Less of?
Classic cars are the priority for restocking. They sell frequently, and they are the highest-performance products.

2. How should we Match Marketing and Communication Strategies to Customer Behaviour?
VIP customers

Least engaged customers

Now that we have the most-important and least-committed customers, we can determine how to drive loyalty and attract more customers.

3. How much can we spend on Acquiring New Customers?
4. 
LTV tells us how much profit an average customer generates during their lifetime with our store. We can use it to predict our future profit. So, if we get ten new customers next month, we'll earn 390,395 dollars, and we can decide based on this prediction how much we can spend on acquiring new customers.
